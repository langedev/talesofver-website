## Stamina

Is a representation of your current health, energy, and mental or emotional ability to continue to act. It is most commonly reduced by physical, mental, or spiritual DMG, but may also fall due to physical, mental, or spiritual exhaustion or duress. 

Your maximum Stamina is determined first by your race, and is increased by rolling your Stamina Die (which is also granted by your race but may be modified by Advancements) and adding the result to your maximum Stamina. A Stamina Die Roll may be prompted by Advancements or reaching certain Advancement tiers, and also occurs when you first create a character.

## Guards

All characters have three different Guards, attacks made against a target act as a Check made against one of these three guards, which must succeed to affect their target. 

The three Guards are as follows:

* Mind Guard, targeted by deception, stealth, and mental attacks.
* Body Guard, targeted by physical harm, poison, disease, and so on.
* Spirit Guard, targeted by persuasion, emotions, and spiritual attacks.

*While all characters have some amount of each Guard, all characters have significant weaknesses to be targeted and strengths to be avoided across their three Guards.*

## Impacts

When you reach 0 Stamina, you suffer a dramatic Impact. Additional DMG dealt past 0 Stamina has no effect and is ignored.

When you suffer an Impact, the following happens:

* An Impact Event at GM discretion.
* You suffer a Guard Break.
* You perform a Death Check.
* If you are still alive, recover up to half your maximum Stamina.

*An Impact Event is some event which drastically alters the current flow or state of an Encounter in a way which is bad for you or your allies. This could be you suffering a severe injury, possibly permanent, to your being knocked through a wall into a new room, dropping your weapon, or gaining a negative Status Effects. Though these are entirely at GM discretion, they will generally get worse the more Impact Events you suffer in a single Encounter.*

## Guard Breaks

When you suffer a Guard Break randomly select one of your unbroken Guards, divide it by half, and mark it as broken. A Guard cannot be broken more than once. Guard Breaks persist even after the current Encounter, but may be healed by resting, being patched up, or a variety of other means.

## Death Checks & Marks

When you perform a Death Check, roll a 1d2, on a 1 you gain a Death Mark, on a 2 you do not. If all of your Guards are Broken while performing a Death Check, you automatically fail it. While you can have a single Death Mark and suffer no negative effects, if you ever have two Death Marks at the same time, you die. Death Marks persist even after the current Encounter, but may be healed by resting, being patched up, or a variety of other means.

*M﻿ost enemies and NPCs you'll face suffer Impacts identically to you, meaning once you reduce them to 0 Stamina they also suffer an Impact Event and Break a Guard, but additionally will automatically fail any Death Check they perform. Meaning most enemies and NPCs reliably die on taking their second Impact.*
