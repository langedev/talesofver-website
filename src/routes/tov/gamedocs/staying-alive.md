# Staying Alive

## Stamina
Is a representation of a character’s current health, energy, and ability to move and act of their own free will. It’s most commonly reduced by physical, mental, or spiritual damage, but may also fall due to exhaustion and duress. 

Stamina isn’t just about your physical health. Having a debate with someone, playing a game of wits or skill, a long day at work, being persuaded and pressured by a sleazy shopkeep into buying a more expensive sword, all of these things can and will reduce your, and other’s, Stamina.

*A character’s Stamina is determined first by their Race and then by the Advancements they take. It’s very possible to have two characters of equivalent experience and power with drastically different Stamina. Some characters and enemies will go down after a few hits, while some will survive a seemingly incredible amount of punishment. Plan and strategize accordingly.*



## Guards
All characters have three different Guards, attacks against any character act as a Check made against one of these three guards, which must succeed to affect their target. 
The three Guards are as follows:


* Mind Guard, targeted by mental attacks, deception, stealth, ect.
* Body Guard, targeted by physical attacks, poison, disease, ect.
* Spirit Guard, targeted by spiritual attacks, persuasion, emotions, ect.

Guards are not always static, they can be Broken. When a character suffers a Guard Break, they randomly select one Unbroken Guard, and mark it as Broken. This reduces the Guard’s value by half while the Break persists. A Broken Guard cannot be Broken again. A Broken Guard can be healed by resting, or some powerful healing effects.

Unbroken Guards also protect a character against Major Status Effects, things which temporarily or permanently remove a character’s ability to act of their own free will. An Unbroken Body Guard would protect against being frozen alive, an Unbroken Spirit Guard would protect a character from being sent into a state of mindless terror, and an Unbroken Mind Guard would protect a character from being mind controlled or brainwashed.

*While all characters have some amount of each Guard, all characters have significant weaknesses to be targeted and strengths to be avoided across their three Guards. Discovering which Guards a character is strong in, or weak against, can be absolutely crucial information, and could turn an unwinnable Encounter into a very manageable one.*


## Impacts
When a character reaches 0 Stamina, they suffer an Impact. Additional damage dealt past 0 Stamina has no effect and is ignored.

When a character suffers an Impact, the following happens:
1. An Impact Event at GM discretion.
2. They suffer a Guard Break.
3. They perform a Death Check.
4. If they are still alive, they recover to half maximum Stamina.

An Impact Event is an event which drastically alters the current state of an Encounter. This could be the Impacted character suffering a severe injury, possibly permanent, to being knocked through a wall into a new room, dropping their weapon, or gaining negative Status Effects. Though these are entirely at GM discretion, they will generally get worse the more Impact Events an individual character has suffered in an Encounter.


## Death Checks & Marks
When a character performs a Death Check they roll a d2, and on a 1 gain a Death Mark. If all of the character’s Guards are Broken while they automatically fail all Death Checks. A character who has two Death Marks at the same time dies. Death Marks persist even after the current Encounter, but may be healed by resting, or some powerful healing effects.
Most enemies and NPCs you'll face suffer Impacts identically to you. Once you reduce them to 0 Stamina they also suffer an Impact Event and a Guard Break, but will automatically fail any Death Check they perform. Most enemies and NPCs reliably die upon taking their second Impact.
