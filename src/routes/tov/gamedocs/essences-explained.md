### Motus
Motus is the essence of movement, and motion. Motus enhances and creates motion in an action. 

When empowering some basic actions with Motus, it will cause the following effects,
- A disengage action empowered with Motus will not cost an impulse. 
- A movement action empowered with Motus will move 1.5 times further, meaning instead of moving 4m you'll move 6m. 

When empowering more complex actions with Motus the following effects have been observed, though they are not guaranteed.
- As the doors was closing Garndark was able to empower their bow shot with Motus to squeeze their arrow through the doorway and kill their opponent.
- As he was just about to fall off a cliff, Durin II created a Fire Spell out of Ignis and Motus to jet power himself to safety.
- While trying to steal a goblet that had caught his eye from the top of a bookshelf, Shpeckle forcefully pushed a book back into the shelf. Empowering the action with Motus the goblet perfectly fell into Shpeckles backpack just before the shopkeep turned around.
